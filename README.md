Microsoft.Recognizers.Text provides robust recognition and resolution of numbers, units, and date/time expressed in multiple languages. Full support for English, Spanish, and Chinese. Partial support for French and Portuguese. More on the way.

Nuget packages - for the base classes and the different supported entities - are available in nuget.org at: https://nuget.org/profiles/BotFramework

Microsoft.Recognizers.Text currently has implementations in C# and Javascript!

Contributions are greatly welcome! Both for fixes in the current supported languages and expansions to new ones.
Especially for Japanese, Korean, German, and Dutch.
